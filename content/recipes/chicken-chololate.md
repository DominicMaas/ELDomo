This recipe for Chocolate Rotisserie Chicken is inspired by the classic dish from the French rotisserie. It is a simple, yet delicious way to cook chicken that is sure to please everyone at the table.

The chicken is first coated in a mixture of cocoa powder, sugar, and spices. The chicken is then marinated in a rich chocolate sauce, and cooked slowly on a rotisserie until it is juicy and tender. The chocolate sauce adds a deep, rich flavor to the chicken, and the rotisserie cooking method ensures that the chicken stays moist and juicy.

The resulting chicken is juicy and succulent, with a slight hint of chocolate flavor.
