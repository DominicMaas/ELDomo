Please help. I tried making the chicken el domino style and it so happens that as a result of my futile attempts at a recipe so revered in its culinary prowess I have burnt down my home to a mere crisp with my entire, once loving family inside. I sit here amongst the burning wreckage of my abode in tears writing this, you must know what it feels to have lost those you hold so dear to you. p.s the chicken was amazing!!!
